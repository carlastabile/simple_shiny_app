# Simple Shiny App
A small shiny app I did for Advanced Data Visualization course while studying my masters in Data Science at Universitat de Valencia.

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a web application framework for R. 

This project was about creating a simple app that loads a dataset and makes plots, histograms, boxplots and some basic statistics with it. 

To run this project download the source code, open it in RStudio and run the `app.R` file as a regular R script. RStudio will launch it as a Shiny app.
